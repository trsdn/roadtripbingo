# Migration Guide: IndexedDB to SQLite

## Overview

Road Trip Bingo has been upgraded from IndexedDB to SQLite for improved data management, performance, and reliability. This guide explains the migration process for existing users.

## What's Changed

### Benefits of SQLite

- **Better Performance**: Faster data operations and queries
- **Data Integrity**: ACID compliance ensures data consistency
- **Backup & Restore**: Built-in tools for data export/import
- **API Access**: RESTful endpoints for data operations
- **Versioning**: Database schema versioning support

### Backward Compatibility

- Your existing data will be automatically migrated
- No manual intervention required
- Original data remains intact during migration
- Automatic rollback if migration fails

## Automatic Migration Process

When you first load the application after the upgrade:

1. **Detection**: The system detects existing IndexedDB data
2. **Validation**: Validates data integrity before migration
3. **Backup**: Creates a backup of your IndexedDB data
4. **Migration**: Transfers all data to the new SQLite database
5. **Verification**: Ensures all data was migrated correctly
6. **Cleanup**: Optionally removes old IndexedDB data

## What Gets Migrated

- **Icons**: All custom icons with metadata
- **Settings**: User preferences and configuration
- **Card Generations**: Saved bingo card sets

## Migration Timeline

The migration process typically takes a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the amount of data:

- **Small datasets** (< 50 icons): 2-5 seconds
- **Medium datasets** (50-200 icons): 10-30 seconds
- **Large datasets** (200+ icons): 1-3 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails

If the migration fails:

1. The system automatically rolls back to IndexedDB
2. Your original data remains intact
3. Check the browser console for error details
4. Try refreshing the page to retry migration

### Data Issues

If you notice missing or corrupted data after migration:

1. Check the browser console for migration logs
2. Use the backup/restore feature to restore from backup
3. Report the issue with console logs for investigation

### Performance Issues

If the application feels slower after migration:

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Restart the browser
3. Check for browser console errors

## Manual Backup (Optional)

Before migration, you can create a manual backup:

1. Open the application (before upgrading)
2. Go to Settings â†’ Data Management
3. Click "Export Data" to download a backup file
4. Save the backup file in a safe location

## Post-Migration Features

After migration, you'll have access to new features:

- **API Access**: Direct database access via REST API
- **Advanced Backup**: Multiple backup formats (JSON, SQL)
- **Better Performance**: Faster loading and saving
- **Data Integrity**: Automatic data validation

## Rollback (Emergency Only)

If you need to rollback to IndexedDB (not recommended):

1. This requires developer intervention
2. Contact support with your backup file
3. Manual data restoration may be required

## Support

If you encounter any issues during migration:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Try the migration process again (refresh the page)
3. Use manual backup files for data restoration
4. Report issues with detailed error logs

## FAQ

### Q: Will I lose my data during migration?
**A:** No, the migration process preserves all your data and includes automatic rollback if issues occur.

### Q: Can I continue using the app during migration?
**A:** No, please wait for the migration to complete before using the application.

### Q: What if migration takes too long?
**A:** Large datasets may take several minutes. Please be patient and don't refresh the page during migration.

### Q: Can I go back to IndexedDB after migration?
**A:** Rollback is possible but not recommended. Contact support if needed.

### Q: Will my custom icons be preserved?
**A:** Yes, all custom icons, settings, and card generations will be migrated exactly as they were.

## Technical Details

For developers and advanced users:

- Migration uses transactional operations for data safety
- SQLite database is stored in the `/data` directory
- Backup files are automatically created before migration
- Database schema is versioned for future upgrades
- Migration logs are available in browser console
