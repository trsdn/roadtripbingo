# Test Fixtures

This directory contains HTML files used for manual testing and debugging during development.

## Files

- **debug-navigation.html** - Tests navigation between Generator and Icon Manager pages
- **test-icon-manager.html** - Tests Icon Manager system functionality and API endpoints

## Usage

These files are for development and debugging purposes only. They can be opened directly in a browser while the development server is running (`npm start`).

To use:
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Open the fixture file in your browser
3. Use the test buttons and UI to verify functionality

## Note

These files are not part of the automated test suite. For automated testing, see the main `tests/` directory with Jest and Playwright tests.
